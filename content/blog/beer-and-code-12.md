# Elm @ beer + code 🍺

I gave a talk about [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) at a local community meetup [Beer+Code Ried](https://beercoderied.at/event/beer-code-12/).

Therefore I built a little presentation.  
It´s built for an audience that are mostly developers but have never heard of Elm before.

I want to share the presentation, so anyone can use it as well.  
So use it, change it, copy it or create issues and pull requests.  
Or just [contact me](/contact) to talk about it. 📧
